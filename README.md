# Catchamouse16 paper - specific code.
This branch is intended to be a pipeline to reproduce the results and figures from the catchamouse16 paper draft.

## Overview of pipeline
The pipeline to reproduce to figures involves specific data wrangling and then implmentation of the general pipeline from C.H. Lubba, S.S. Sethi, P. Knaute, S.R. Schultz, B.D. Fulcher, N.S. Jones. [_catch22_: CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-019-00647-x). *Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery* (2019) and the corresponding repo [_catch22_](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22)

To reproduce the figures:
1. Wrangle data
2. Run python workflow.py
